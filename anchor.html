      The Royal Enfield Bullet has the longest and unchanged production run of
      any motorcycle having remained continuously in production since 1948. The
      Bullet marque is even older and has passed 75 years of continuous
      production.<br />
      The oldest motorcycle brand in continuous production, Royal Enfield made
      its first motorcycle in 1901. A division of Eicher Motors Limited, Royal
      Enfield has created the mid-sized motorcycle segment in India with its
      unique and distinctive modern classic bikes.
