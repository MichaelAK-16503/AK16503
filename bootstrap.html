                Based on the keywords you enter, the domain name generator
                creates unique combinations and produces several suggestions
                with different domain extensions. Our search tool also works as
                a domain checker, so it will never suggest a name that isn't
                actually available to register. Our domain name generator is
                engineered by folks who have extensive experience in the domain
                field, and it is backed by the knowledge that GoDaddy, the
                world's largest domain name registrar, has accumulated over 20+
                years of leadership in the industry.</strong

                >Here are some tips for crafting the perfect domain name: Keep
                it short, as shorter domains are easier for people to remember.
                Avoid numbers, hyphens, or any special characters that would be
                difficult for users to type or remember. Poll friends and family
                to get opinions on which one you should choose. If you end up
                liking more than one domain, the smart move would be to register
                them all. That will let you take your time deciding without the
                risk of someone else swooping up the name you ultimately decide
                you want.</strong

                >Today there are hundreds of extensions (called top-level
                domains or TLDs) in addition to the standard .com, .net, and
                .org. That means, if your domain name search doesnâ€™t bring back
                a .com that you would like to use, you can still find the right
                domain name with one of the newer extensions. Since TLDs can
                cater to specific niches and industries, these extensions might
                be better aligned with the startup or brand that you want to
                build. For example, there are TLDs for certain regions (.us,
                .ca, .co.uk, etc.) and different types of businesses (.club,
                .restaurant, .plumbing, etc.). But there are also TLDs that are
                general and can work as fun catch-alls for all kinds of websites
                (.xyz, .fyi, .wtf, etc). While it never hurts to check domain
                availability for a .com, the variety of TLDs available provide
                you with a lot more options and the ability to get really
                creative. In fact, they could provide you with some of the best
                domain name ideas.</strong
